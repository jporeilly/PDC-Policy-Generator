"""New tabs in the desktop window - the two ways they silently die.

The desktop shell shows the app in a webview pointed at
http://127.0.0.1:<port>. Two things about that window are invisible from a
browser:

1. The shell's opener plugin cancels every click on a link that opens a new
   tab and asks the shell to open it in the system browser. Capabilities
   cover only the shell's own start-up page unless one names the served
   pages, so the request was refused - after the click was already gone.
   Every such link was dead in the installed app.
2. `window.open()` returns null there: the window has no second window to
   give, so a button built on it does nothing.

None of this can be exercised without the shell, so these hold the pieces in
place: the grant, its narrowness, and where `window.open()` may appear.
