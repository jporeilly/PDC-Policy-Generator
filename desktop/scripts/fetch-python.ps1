.SYNOPSIS
    Vendor a self-contained Python runtime into the installer.

.DESCRIPTION
    Downloads the official Windows "embeddable package" into
    src-tauri\vendor\python and installs the app's requirements alongside it,
    so the shipped app depends on nothing already present on the machine.

    Why the embeddable zip rather than PyInstaller: the suite standard (see the
    Glossary Generator, whose driver set PyInstaller genuinely mishandles).
    This app's dependency set is tiny, but a vendored tree is still just
    files - what was tested is what ships - and one packaging recipe across
    the PDC-Demo apps beats a second one that can drift.

    Idempotent - skips the download when the pinned version is already staged.

.PARAMETER Version
    Python version to vendor. Keep this on a version with wheels for every
    dependency; the app itself supports 3.10+.

.PARAMETER Force
    Re-download and rebuild even when the stamp matches.

.NOTES
    Windows PowerShell 5.1+. ASCII-only on purpose.
